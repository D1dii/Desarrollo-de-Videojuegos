Let Him Cook!

Description: You're in a tilter platformer. Control your power and jump through the obstacles to reach the top. Face your enemies and most importantly,
don't fall!

Controls:

A: Move left
D: Move right

Hold Spacebar: Charge Jump
Release Spacebar: Jump
(Note: Similar mechanic to other games like Jump King, where, the more you press the jump button, the further you'll jump. Use this mechanic to
cover various distances and heights with your jump. Precision is key to avoid falling down.)

Debug options:

F1: Spawn at the start of the map.
F2: Spawn at the debug checkpoint 1.
F3: Spawn at the debug checkpoint 2.
F4: Show the powerJump bar for reference.
F9: Show colliders and pathfinding.
F10: Godmode (move with WASD freely through the map).
F11: Change between 30/60 FPS.
