Let Him Cook!

Description: You're in a tilter platformer. Control your power and jump through the obstacles to reach the top. Face your enemies and most importantly,
don't fall! Start Cooking!

# Controls:

A: Move left
D: Move right

S: Attack

Hold Spacebar: Charge Jump

Release Spacebar: Jump

T: Settings (Volume slider, first checkbox is V-Sync, second checkbox is Fullscreen)

B: Back to main menu (cooking pun intended)

W: Go up stairs (OnCollision isn't working as intended, you may need to try a few times)

F5: Save checkpoint

F6: Load last checkpoint

(Note: Similar mechanic to other games like Jump King, where, the more you press the jump button, the further you'll jump. Note that the power
is displayed in a power bar on top of the player's head. Use this mechanic to cover various distances and heights with your jump. 
Precision is key to avoid falling down.)

Debug options:

F1: Spawn at the start of the map.

F2: Spawn at the debug checkpoint 1.

F3: Spawn at the debug checkpoint 2.

F9: Show colliders and pathfinding.

F10: Godmode (move with WASD freely through the map and become invincible).

F11: Change between 30/60 FPS.
